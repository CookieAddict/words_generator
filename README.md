TypeScript function to generate words from string input.

I used an external resource as the source for my English dictionary.

Minimal installation steps required:
```
npm install
```

```
npx tsc
``` 

```
node wordsGenerator.js
```

The function is called within the file so an update to the input will require transpiling TypeScript again.
